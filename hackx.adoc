# HackX

Extensions to Hack

## Halt

The Halt hack instruction will cause the CPU's PC to stop incrementing.
The PC can be re-enabled by sending the Reset signal, which will clear the PC to 0x0000 and put it back in counting mode.

## NOOP, noop

A shorthand for A0, the A instruction which loads 0 into the A register and does nothing else.
Exists to allow the asm to fill in areas of the output assembly as needed.

## ALUX - Extended Arithmetic

`1 1x m cccccc ddd jjj`

In a hack c instruction, the second bit becomes an "Arithmetic" instruction.
When set to 1, the machine will perform ALU arithmetic.
The third bit will choose between standard (when 1) and eXtended (when 0).
The ALU will read from memory if the m bit is set; will use the c bits to control the logic, and d bits to control where to store results.
In standard mode, the j bits control the jump destination.
In extended mode, the j bits select additional arithmetic operations.

jjj | Operation                 | ASM Cmp | Hack VM
----|---------------------------|---------|---------
000 | left shift                | SHL {n} | shift-left {n}
001 | right shift               | SHR {n} | shift-right {n}
010 | integer multiplication    | MUL     | mul
011 | integer division          | DIV     | div
100 | floating point add        | FADD    | fadd 
101 | floating point subtract   | FSUB    | fsub
110 | floating point multiply   | FMUL    | fmul
111 | floating point divide     | FDIV    | fdiv

Shift uses either the lower 4 c-bits, or the lowest 4 m bits (based on mMode) to determine the amount of places to shift.
Left shift is 0 fill, right shift is signed fill, to keep with the multiplication/division pattern.
When an immediate shift amount is provided to the VM, a single value is popped and pushed.
When no immediate shift amount is provided, the top stack value is used as the shift amount (and popped from the stack).

ALUX has an expanded out bit buffer:
ng zr ov nan inf

The ALU out buffer can be read at 0xFFFF?
@FFFF
D=M
@R13
M=D

## Interrupts

### Interrupt Instructions

Instruction             | Operation
------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
`            1aaa a000` | Out of band, put the CPU in interrupt mode & jmp a |
`1 0x 0 ???? 1aaa a000` | Put CPU in interrupts mode, and jump to a          |
`1 01 0 ???? ???? ????` | Restore CPU to normal mode, and jump to last PC    |

The Computer adds an 8-bit interrupt bus, along with a software interrupt signal.
On receiving a 1 in the interrupt bus, or the software interrupt signal, the CPU caches inM, A, D, the PC, the ALU status bus.
The CPU then marks as in interrupt state. If any interrupt commands arrive while in the interrupt, they are ignored.
The CPU then jumps to the address specified by the interrupt.
The last three bits of the interrupt must be 0, leaving 8 instructions for machine start:

```
@256
D=A
@SP
M=D
@Sys.init
0;JMP
NOOP
NOOP
```

### Interrupt processing

Peripherals have mapped regions

Write LENGTH bytes from MEM[OFFSET] into the device at IRQ#
WRITE IRQ# OFFSET LENGTH

Read LENGTH bytes from IRQ device into MEM starting at [OFFSET]

IRQ1 Keyboard
IRQ2 Mouse
IRQ3 Video memory
IRQ4 Hard drive
